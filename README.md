The application can be imported as a maven project (importing the pom file).
Before running the application locally you need to compile the widgetset
and the theme.
Run:
```
mvn package
```
After starting mongoDB HikingHelper itself should be run as a Spring Boot Application with the main class set to com.unibz.hikinghelper.Application
